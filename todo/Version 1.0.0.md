Logging: Instead of just showing the history in the UI, you could save a detailed log of user actions and errors to a file. This will help with troubleshooting and user support.
!!!Additional File Formats: Add support for other archive formats such as .rar, .7z, and others. You'd need libraries that support these formats.
Batch Conversion: Allow users to convert multiple videos to GIFs (or the opposite) in one go, maybe even with parallel processing for faster results.
!!!Preview: Provide a preview for selected files, especially for images and videos. This could be beneficial when converting from MP4 to GIF, as the user can preview the MP4 before conversion.
Password Protection: Allow users to create password-protected zip files and also add the ability to unzip password-protected archives.
!!!Compression Level: Provide an option for users to choose the compression level when zipping files, which can determine the balance between file size and compression time.
Notifications: If a process like conversion or zipping takes a while, notify the user when it's done, maybe even using system notifications.
!!Updates: Add a feature to check for software updates from within the app.
Cloud Integration: Allow users to directly upload zipped/compressed files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3.
!!File Splitting: When zipping, give users the option to split the archive into parts (e.g., 100MB chunks). This is handy when trying to transfer larger files through methods with file size limits.
Custom Themes: Let users customize the theme more than just light and dark, maybe even allowing them to define their colors or import theme files.
Localization: If you anticipate users from different regions, adding multi-language support can be a significant enhancement.
!!Drag-and-Drop Folders: Currently, the app supports drag-and-drop for files, but you can extend this to support entire folders.
File Explorer Integration: On certain OSs, you can integrate your app into the file explorer's context menu. So users can right-click on a file and directly choose to zip, unzip, convert, etc., using your application.
Plugins or Extensions: Design the application in a way that allows other developers to create plugins or extensions, further enhancing its functionality.
CLI Support: Some users prefer command-line tools. Offering a command-line version or support for your tool can cater to this audience.
Automated Tasks: Allow users to set up automated tasks, e.g., every time a .mp4 file appears in a particular folder, automatically convert it to .gif.
